## Gotta Start Somewhere

Day 4 of development and things are going along smoothly, considering this is my first large scale game project. As is standard with with Pre-Alpha, everything you see is placeholder, though that will hopefully start to change in a month or so.

There is still so much to do. All that is really done now is the movement and interaction system. I'm using Fable: Aniverssery as a base concept and chagning it where I see fit.

As I've only made some very small prototypes in Unity before (My go-to engine of choice had previously been GameMaker2), this has been a steep learning curve for me, although climbing it is going faster than I originally anticipated. Learning the UnityEvent sytem has been a big part in my productivity, as it makes scripts triggering each other _much_ easier, allwoing everything to be modular.

With any luck, I hope to exit Pre-Alpha by July, and get some real final game assets integrated.

New updates soon!
